		<h1> Welcome to my web page </h1>
		<br />
		<h2> (Lets learn HTML!) </h2>
		<br />
		<p> Before we start let me tell you a little about myself. 
		This is the 1<sup>st</sup> time that I have taught this course. 
		I was born at a very young age and grew in wisdom and grace until now.
		Of course, I hope to continue to grow in both wisdom and grace but that will require effort and attention to what is happening in the world and in myself.
		I hope you learn a lot about web programming and are enlightened by what we do in the class. Good luck! </p>

		<p> When writing web pages you need to make sure you are attentive to lots of details like structure and formatting of the page.
		I want to <emp>emphasize</emp> to you the importance of this. </p>
		<hr />
		<p> I want to make sure that you understand what I mean so I would like to quote myself.
		<br />
		<blockquote> It is very important to be aware of all the small details when writting web pages.
		Afterall, small details can make a big difference. Be concious of what you are learning and why you are learning it.
			We will certainly learn a lot in this class but we must always exert effort to learn. </blockquote>
