    <h3> What is Paradox? </h3>

    <p> Pardox Interactive is a Swedish game development studio best known for historical
      grand strategy games. They are based in Stockholm, hoowever, their games
      are popular internationally. They carry a mostly positive reputation, creating
      quality video games and continuing to support games years after launch. This
      continued support for titles they've released makes consumers happy, having
      a game perfected rather than a new title coming out every year. Many of these
      titles are supported by their most well known subsidiary, Paradox Development Studio. </p>
