    <h3> About </h3>

    <p> I have played all of these game series' latest additions and have enjoyed
      each one. Europa Universalis is the most balanced in the gameplay, you play as
      a country and control it for the game's time period. Crusader Kings takes a different
      approach on mechanics, having the player play as a dynasty instead of as a country.
      Hearts of Iron focuses on the war aspect of a country, and Victoria focuses
      on economics primarily. </p>
