        <h3> Endnotes </h3>
          <p> Endnotes are where you put your citations that you used in your paper. Any quote,
            paraphrase, or summary must be cited in this portion of your paper. You must
            list the full source the first time you cite it in your endnotes, after that you can
            use an abbreviated version. </p>

        <h3> Bibliography </h3>
          <p> The bibliography is a list of all sources used in alphabetical order. You can do
            a biblography manually, and there are many guides for this. However, an easier
            way is to use bibliogrpahy generators such as EasyBib. They will make you life
