        <h2> Welcome to History Helper </h2>
          <p> Writing your first SLUH research paper can be daunting. Even though your
            teachers may provide you with resources, they can seem to get jumbled up and
            unorganized. This website is intended to help clear up confusion on the research
            aspect itself. </p>

        <h3> Primary Sources </h3>
          <p> Primary sources are sources that are direct resources of your topic. In
            other words, they are the inner-most ring in the circle of sources. They
            are not just limited to text. They can be a photographs from a battle, quotes
            from a leader, a letter written at the time, ect. They often contain the
            best material and are sometimes the easiest to work with. The more primary sources
            the better, teachers love to see them! </p>
      </div>
      <div class="grid_2">
        <h3> Secondary Sources </h3>
          <p> Secondary sources contain information valuable to supporting your argument,
            or thesis. They are journal articles, debates over the topic, podcasts, ect.
            Think of them as your second ring, people that agree with you. Having a good
            secondary source is important in validating your argument.</p>
