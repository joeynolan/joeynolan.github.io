    <p> The Cascade Volcanoes (also known as the Cascade Volcanic Arc or the
      Cascade Arc) are a number of volcanoes in a volcanic in western North
      America, extending from southwestern British Columbia through Washington
      and Oregon to Northern California, a distance well over 700 miles (1,100km).
      The arc has formed due to subduction along the Cascadia subduction zone.
      Although taking its name from the Cascade Range, this term is a geologic
      grouping rather than a geographic one, and the Cascade Volcanoes extending
      north into the Coast Mountains, past the Fraser River which is the northward
      limit of the Cascade Range proper. </p>
